# Self-Service-Automated-System
Developed a Self-service automated system to alert customers about potential drug interactions for both prescription and over-the-counter drugs. Many medications should not be taken together or should not be taken if a patient has certain symptoms and allergies. Evaluating all the criteria for whether a patient can take a particular medication requires the patient's medical history and expert knowledge from a health care provider. The system, however, can provide an instant guideline to keep patients informed and minimize the risk.
